# RoboStig - Leveraging Amazon SageMake to build an Autonomous Self-driving Car

This repository contains the prototype for a Level 300-400 re:Invent 2018 Bootcamp where participants will leverage [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) to perform the following:

1. Drive a vehicle on a mock track using a [Self-Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) to capture the vehicle's telemetry.
2. Create a Machine Learning (ML) Pipeline, using the telemetry data, to clone the driving behavior as part of a Deep Learning model.
3. Deploy the behavioral cloning model to a production SageMaker Inference Endpoint.
4. Use the Endpoint to autonomously drive the vehicle around a second mock track.
