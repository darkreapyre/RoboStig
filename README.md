# RoboStig - Leveraging Amazon SageMaker to build an Autonomous Self-driving Car.

If you're familiar with the British motoring television series [Top Gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_Gear_(2002_TV_series)), then you are very familiar with [The Stig](https://www.topgear.com/car-news/stig).

>__"The Stig is a character on the British motoring television show Top Gear. The character is a play on the anonymity of racing drivers' full-face helmets, with the running joke that nobody knows who is inside the Stig's racing suit. The Stig's primary role is setting lap times for cars tested on the show." - Wikipedia__

In this bootcamp, you will create your own __Stig__ by way of a Machine Learning (ML) technique called, __Behavioral Cloning__. This is where a ML model learns to mimmic procedural knowledge through observation.

You will teach your *Stig* to test drive a car around a fictional track by driving a vehicle in a [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim), courtesy of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/). 

Once you've acquired the observational data, you will leverage [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker) and create a *Machine Learning Pipeline*
