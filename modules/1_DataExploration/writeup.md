# View the Data
A full log of the driving observations is recorded in the `driving_log.csv` file. This file also includes the images captured from the *Left*, *Center* and *Right* camera angles from the vehicle. You will leverage this log, as well as the images, to train your model. But first, it's a good idea to view the contents of this file and derive some insights.

In the following code cells, we use the `pandas` library to create a tabular format of the first five rows of the `driving_log.csv` file.
